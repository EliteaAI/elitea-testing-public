# Chat-interface surface — exploration digest

Handle cache for live-confirmed handles/quirks on the Chat surface (`/chat`).
Not a substitute for execution — verify a handle as you use it. One writer at

## Conversation context menu — "Move to" submenu (ELITEA-2135/2137)
- **CONFIRMED DEFECT, filed EliteaAI/elitea-testing-public#1117**: the "Move
  to" menu item's submenu (Create folder / Back to the list / existing
  folders) does NOT open reliably. Hovering it (even real mouse movement +
  1.5s dwell, 0/2) and keyboard `ArrowRight` (0/1, after `ArrowDown`×2 focus)
  never open it. A plain click — the item's own coded activation gesture
  (`ConversationItem.jsx`: `hasSubMenu: true`, `DotMenu.jsx`'s
  `BasicMenuItem`: `onClick={subMenuItems?.length ? onClickMenu : onClick}`)
  — opened it on the first attempt in roughly half of ~6 isolated repros and
  needed a second click the rest of the time; clicking again while it IS
  open closes it (backdrop click-away). **Automation workaround**: click,
  poll for `.MuiPopover-root` count to go 1→2 (or for
  `chat-move-to-create-folder-menuitem` to become visible) within ~350ms,
  retry the click if not — reaches the open state reliably within 1–2
  attempts every time. See `ChatPage.open_move_to_submenu()` (specced,
  ELITEA-2135's AFS).
- Submenu items previously rendered ZERO testids regardless of `key` — a
  SEPARATE, purely cosmetic gap from the defect above: `DotMenu.jsx`'s
  `BasicMenuItem` nested-submenu rendering (`subMenuItems.map(...)`) never
  forwarded `testId` to `subCommonProps` at all. Fixed this pass (commit
  `cf348d32`, `automation/testids`): `chat-move-to-create-folder-menuitem`,
  `chat-move-to-back-to-list-menuitem`, `chat-move-to-folder-{folder_id}-menuitem`
  (dynamic, one per existing folder — the `folderItems.map()` call in
  `Conversations.jsx` had NO `key` field at all before this pass, which ALSO
  meant two same-named folders — e.g. two default-named "New folder"s —
  collided on React's fallback key (`subMenuItem.key || subMenuItem.label`),
  producing a live-confirmed "two children with the same key" console
  warning; fixed by the same `key` addition).
- Toast on move: `Chat moved to "${targetFolder.name}" folder successfully`
  (source: `useMoveToFolderConversation.hooks.js`) — WITH quote marks around
  the folder name; the case texts' paraphrase ("Chat moved to [folder name]
  folder successfully") omits them — cosmetic case-text drift, not a defect.
- "Move to" is DISABLED while the conversation is pinned
  (`ConversationItem.jsx`: `disabled: isPinned || ...`) — a pin/move-to test
  pairing needs an UNPINNED conversation.
- "Move to" > "Create folder" seeds a CLIENT-SIDE-ONLY placeholder folder
  (`isNew: true`, default name "New folder") the instant it's clicked; the
  REAL server-side folder + the actual conversation move only happen on
  confirm (`moveTargetConversationToNewFolder()`: `createFolder()` THEN
  `onMoveToFolderConversation()`) — same two-phase shape ELITEA-2132 already
  documented for the CHATS-header create-folder button, but this entry
  point's confirm ALSO moves a conversation in the same action (and DOES
  show a toast) — the two "Create folder" entry points are similar-looking
  but functionally different flows, don't conflate them.

## Pin conversation (ELITEA-2149)
- `chat-conversation-menu-pin-menuitem` (pre-existing, ELITEA-2114) — single
  click, no submenu, NOT affected by the "Move to" defect above (0 flake
  across every repro this pass).
- "Pin on top" is DISABLED when the conversation is already inside a folder
  AND not currently pinned (`disabled: !isPinned && !!conversation.folder_id`)
  — pin tests need an conversation that's NOT inside a folder.
- ADDED this pass (commit `cf348d32`): `data-pinned="true"/"false"` on
  `chat-conversation-item-{id}` (mirrors the pre-existing `data-active`
  attribute, ELITEA-2114); `chat-pin-icon` testid on the inline `PinIcon`
  usage inside `ConversationItem.jsx` (conditionally rendered
  `{isPinned && !isPlayback && <PinIcon .../>}` — confirmed live 0→1 count
  transition on pin, not a static/always-present icon).
- Panel order (source-confirmed, `Conversations.jsx`'s literal JSX order):
  pinned folders → `<PinnedConversations>` → unpinned folders →
  date-grouped/ungrouped conversations. Live-verified 2 of these 4 tiers
  (pinned conversation Y=56, well above "Today" heading Y=178–260 across
  repro runs) — a full 4-tier live check needs a seeded pinned FOLDER, which
  no case so far has needed; flagged as a follow-up opportunity, not done.
- No success toast on pin (`usePinConversation.hooks.js`'s
  `onPinConversation` only calls `toastError` on FAILURE) — don't wait for
  one.

## Conversation search (ELITEA-2162)
- `conversation-search-button` (on-main) opens `conversation-search-input`
  (on-main) + an X/clear icon — but the folder/date-group list is **not**
  replaced on click alone; it stays visible until a query is actually typed
  (500ms debounce). Case text sometimes implies immediate replacement — it
  isn't (issue #1114).
- The X/clear icon (`IconButton onClick={handleSearchClear}` in
  `Conversations.jsx`) has **no testid** — needs `add-data-testid`
  (`conversation-search-clear-button`).
- Filtering is server-driven: `GET /elitea_core/folder/prompt_lib/{projectId}
  ?...&query=<value>&grouped=true`, case-insensitive substring match on
  conversation name. Matching rows get testid
  `chat-conversation-item-{conversation.id}` — **on `automation/testids`
  only**, not yet on `main` as of 2026-08-03.
- Clicking a result: URL becomes `/chat/{id}?name=<name>`, search input stays
  visible (doesn't auto-close).

## Modules panel / internal tools toggle (ELITEA-2162)
- `plus-menu-button` (on-main) → **hover** (not click) the `Modules`
  menuitem, testid `internal-tools-menuitem` (on-main; same-element
  conditional pair, `undefined` on the unused branch — compliant #277
  shape (a)). Existing `ChatPage.internal_tools_menuitem` field uses a raw
  `has-text("Modules")` locator instead of this testid — pre-existing tech
  debt, worth fixing when next touched.
- 7 toggle switches render (`role="switch"`, MUI `Switch.BaseSwitch`), each
  with **zero testid** — only locatable via accessible name (`label` prop =
  the tool's `title`). Stable underlying keys (from
  `internalTools.constants.js`): `image_generation`, `data_analysis`,
  `internal_mcp`, `planner`, `pyodide`, `swarm`, `lazy_tools_mode`. Needs
  `add-data-testid` with a dynamic pattern: `modules-toggle-{tool_key}`.
- Toggling any switch PUTs `meta.internal_tools` via
  `useConversationEditMutation` (same endpoint family as
  `ConversationAPI.rename_conversation`), then shows the app-wide
  `toast-message` toast with text **`"Modules configuration updated"`**
  (lowercase "u" — case text across ELITEA-2162/2464 says "Updated", issue
  #1115).
- **`Escape` does NOT close the panel** (live-confirmed: switch count stayed
  at 7 after `Escape`). Closing requires an outside click (anywhere in the
  main chat/message area) — that took the switch count to 0.

## Sibling TMS cases — near-duplicate scope
ELITEA-2463 (search) and ELITEA-2464 (Modules panel) are both still
`draft`/unautomated (tracking cards #971/#972) and are, respectively, a more
granular breakdown of ELITEA-2162's steps 1–4 and 5–9. Once ELITEA-2162's
spec merges, both should very likely resolve `already-covered` /
`extend-existing` against it — sequence their analysis after this one lands.

## Streaming / in-progress response widget (ELITEA-2181)
- The "loading indicator" shown between Send and content-arrival is
  `RotatingMessages.jsx` — text-cycling placeholder ("Waking the agent…", …),
  NOT a `CircularProgress` spinner. No testid.
- Once content starts, a "Thought for `<n>` secs" accordion
  (`ApplicationThinkView.jsx` → `ActionView.jsx`) carries the model-name chip
  AND the "Pause scroll"/"Resume scroll" toggle — both scoped to that
  accordion, not the message bubble or page level. Neither has a testid.
  Clicking the toggle flips its own label (confirmed) — that's the stable
  automation signal, not a scrollTop delta (only proves out when the
  conversation's content genuinely overflows the viewport).
- Message action icons (Read-out/speaker, Copy, Regenerate, Delete) only
  render **on hover** over the message block. Confirmed testids:
  `chat-read-out-button`, `chat-delete-button` (both on `main`). Copy has
  NO testid but does get an MUI-auto-injected `aria-label="Copy to
  clipboard"` (its `StyledTooltip` wraps the `IconButton` directly).
  **Regenerate has NEITHER testid NOR aria-label** — its `StyledTooltip`
  wraps a bare `<Box>`, breaking MUI's auto aria-label injection. The page
  object's existing `copy_message_button`/`regenerate_button`
  `LocatorDescriptor`s reference stale, nonexistent testids
  (`message-copy-button`/`message-regenerate-button`) — pre-existing tech
  debt (not introduced by ELITEA-2181), still functioning today only via
  their `fallback=` role/aria-label lookups. Don't reuse those dead names
  when adding real testids — follow the live sibling convention instead
  (`chat-copy-button`/`chat-regenerate-button`).
- The last message's `Answer` block carries a **same-element,
  state-conditional testid** (`ApplicationAnswer.jsx:640`):
  `data-testid={isLastMessage ? 'skill-test-last-response' :
  'chat-answer-content'}` — pre-existing tech debt (not this case's
  anti-pattern to fix). For any single-exchange test the value will be
  `skill-test-last-response` (misleadingly named — unrelated to Skills).
  Scope through the parent `chat-message-item` container instead of either
  literal string.
- This environment's default chat participant answered "write a poem"
  requests by invoking a file-writing TOOL (visible via "I'll create this
  poem in a file for you." + an artifact reference), not a plain text
  completion — full generation took 34–54s across 4 live runs. Don't assume
  a short prompt like this completes quickly; size waits ≥90s.

## "+ Create New Agent" canvas + Build with AI (ELITEA-1920/2166)
- `ChatPage.open_create_new_agent_canvas()` (plus_menu_button → hover
  agents_menuitem → click agents-create-new-button) opens `AgentCanvasPage`,
  which renders the SAME `CreateAgentForm.jsx` as `/agents/create` — including
  its conditional `GenerateAgentButton` (`generate-agent-open-button`,
  entityType !== 'pipeline'). Build-with-AI works identically inside the
  canvas as on the standalone create page (same testids, same network
  contract) — confirmed live, ELITEA-1920.
- **Completion wiring differs by host page.** `/agents/create`'s
  `onAgentCreated` auto-navigates to `/agents/all/{id}` (ELITEA-1909). The
  chat canvas's `onAgentCreated` is `src/hooks/chat/useAgentCreation.js`
  instead: it adds the created agent as a chat participant
  (`addNewParticipants`) and auto-activates it — URL stays on
  `/chat?edited_participant_id={id}`, NO navigation away. Don't reuse
  ELITEA-1909's "wait for /agents/all navigation" pattern here; wait on
  `AgentCanvasPage.title` (switches to the agent's name post-creation) or the
  Participants popover instead.
- Participants panel: `ChatPage.open_participants_popover(timeout, section="agents")`
  (pre-existing, ELITEA-2166) — reuse directly, don't re-derive.
- Composer shows `"Editing..."` (not the agent name) while that agent's own
  canvas/editor is still open — a transient state, already documented +
  clarified (issue EliteaAI/elitea-testing-public#709). Don't mistake it for
  a broken participant-name display.

## Fragility note — `switch_project()` to an already-active project
In a from-scratch `sync_playwright` script (no pytest fixture chain),
calling `ChatPage.switch_project(<already-active-project-id>)` was observed
once to leave the composer stuck behind a permanent `MuiCircularProgress`
loading overlay that then blocks `plus-menu-button` clicks entirely (30s
timeout, `<div class="MuiBox-root css-1qkypnf">` intercepts pointer events).
Skipping the redundant switch (project was already correct) avoided it
entirely. Not reproduced through the normal pytest fixture chain — flagging
as a possible transit-path fragility for a from-scratch driver, not filed as
a product defect (never observed via the real test suite's own fixtures).
